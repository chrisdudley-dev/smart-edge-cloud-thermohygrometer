# requirements.txt â€” Edge device (Raspberry Pi)
# Lean runtime dependencies needed on the device itself.
# Notes:
# - Keep this minimal to reduce disk + build time.
# - TensorFlow Lite wheels are architecture-specific (armv7l vs aarch64).

# MQTT client (works for local Mosquitto and AWS IoT Core over 8883)
paho-mqtt>=1.6,<2.0

# Env var management (e.g., for endpoints, topics, thresholds)
python-dotenv>=1.0,<2.0

# Numpy is required by most TFLite models
numpy>=1.24,<3.0

# TensorFlow Lite runtime (install the correct wheel for your Pi architecture)
# Example placeholder below; replace if you pin a specific wheel build.
tflite-runtime==2.14.0 ; platform_machine in "armv7l aarch64"

# Sensor / GPIO stack
# Prefer the maintained CircuitPython DHT stack on modern Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm).
adafruit-blinka>=8.0,<9.0 ; platform_system=="Linux" and platform_machine in "armv7l aarch64"
adafruit-circuitpython-dht>=4.0,<5.0 ; platform_system=="Linux" and platform_machine in "armv7l aarch64"

# If you are using legacy RPi.GPIO-based code, uncomment ONE of the following lines:
# RPi.GPIO>=0.7 ; platform_system=="Linux" and platform_machine in "armv7l aarch64"
# Adafruit_DHT>=1.4 ; platform_system=="Linux" and platform_machine in "armv7l aarch64"

# Optional: If corporate networks require port 443 with ALPN for AWS IoT,
# add the AWS IoT Device SDK v2. Keep commented unless needed.
# awsiotsdk>=1.18,<2.0
# awscrt>=0.20,<1.0
