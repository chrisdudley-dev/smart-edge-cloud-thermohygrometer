## 📖 Overview

The Smart Edge–Cloud Monitor is an IoT system designed to collect real-time environmental data (temperature and humidity) using a Raspberry Pi, and send this data securely to AWS cloud infrastructure for monitoring, logging, and future analysis.

---

## 🌟 Features

- 📡 Sensor-to-Cloud Data Streaming (DHT22 → Pi → AWS IoT Core)
- 🌤 Real-Time Temperature and Humidity Monitoring
- ☁️ Secure Communication over MQTT
- 🗂️ Local Logging with Cloud Sync
- 📊 Cloud Storage with AWS DynamoDB (MVP)
- 📡 Planned Visualization via Web Dashboard

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 (with Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit)
- Python 3.9+ installed
- Internet connectivity (Wi-Fi or Ethernet)
- AWS Account + IAM permissions for IoT Core & DynamoDB

### 💻 Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrisdudley-dev/smart-edge-cloud-monitor.git
cd smart-edge-cloud-monitor
```

### 🧪 Create Virtual Environment
#### Windows
```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
#### macOS / Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 📦 Install Dependencies

**For Local Development / CI**  
Includes runtime + testing, linting, and analysis tools.
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

**For Raspberry Pi Edge Device**  
Minimal runtime dependencies for the Pi itself.  
If using legacy `RPi.GPIO` + `Adafruit_DHT`, uncomment those lines in `requirements.txt` before installing.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**For AWS Lambda Deployment**  
Keep `lambda_requirements.txt` minimal (often empty). Add only extra packages your Lambda handler imports.
```bash
pip install -r lambda_requirements.txt
```

**For Local Testing of Lambda Functions**  
Matches Lambda’s runtime libraries (including boto3/botocore).
```bash
pip install -r lambda_local_requirements.txt
```

---

## 🔍 Usage Example

```bash
python src/main.py
```

Expected Output:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-06T22:11:03Z",
  "temperature_C": 24.6,
  "humidity": 52.4,
  "device_id": "edge-node-001"
}
```

### Data Flow Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Sensor as Edge Device (DHT22, etc.)
    participant Broker as MQTT Broker (Mosquitto / AWS IoT)
    participant IoTCore as AWS IoT Core
    participant Lambda as AWS Lambda
    participant DB as DynamoDB
    participant SNS as SNS Alerts

    Sensor->>Broker: Publish readings (MQTT, JSON)
    Broker->>IoTCore: Forward topic messages
    IoTCore->>Lambda: Invoke rule action
    Lambda->>DB: Store readings
    Lambda->>SNS: Send alert if anomaly detected
```

> The dashed OTA/config (Jobs/Shadow) path is included in both variants.
